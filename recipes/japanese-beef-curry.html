        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Japanese curry</strong>, in contrast to other neighbouring types of curry, tends to be much
            <strong>lighter</strong> in terms of spices as well as <strong>thicker</strong> in terms of texture.
            It can even be surprisingly <strong>sweet</strong>, which makes it <em>perfect</em> for kids and the whole
            family.
            This recipe uses a premade dried curry roux, which can be bought at most Asian grocery stores, making the
            cooking process very <strong>quick and easy</strong>.
            With just a few simple ingredients, one could start and finish cooking within the span of an
            <strong>hour</strong>.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut onions into wedges and sautee for 5 minutes, or until they turn lightly brown</li>
            <li>While onions are cooking, prepare the other vegetables: peel and cut potatoes and carrot into bite-sized
                pieces, mince garlic, grate ginger and apple</li>
            <li>Season and sear beef in large pot, if necessary cook multiple batches and don&lsquo;t overcrowd</li>
            <li>Add onions, and all vegetables to pot, pour in sufficient water</li>
            <li>Bring to boil, let simmer for around 30 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Turn off heat</strong> (the roux tends to burn easily) and add Roux cubes, stirring gently,

            <li>Reheat and simmer for around 5 more minutes</li>
            <li>Serve, with rice</li>
